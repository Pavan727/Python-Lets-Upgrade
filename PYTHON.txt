1) What is python? What are the ways to install python in PC.
Sol : Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high level bulit in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
          To install python , we will install free anaconda distribution.This distribution includes Python as well as many other useful libraries, including Jupyter.
             1. Open Anaconda Navigator
             2. Launch Jyputer NB
             3. Create New folder for our Project in Jyputer console
             4. Rename that "Untitled Folder" to "LU Python Es B6"
             5. Open that folder 
             6. Create new "Python 3 NB"
