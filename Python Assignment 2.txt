                                                                     Lets Upgrade Python Assignment - 2



Day 2 summary


* If we give any statement within double quotes, then that statement will be displayed
    Ex : print("Python class")
		o/p : Python class
* We can also use single quote instead of double quote, but if there is another single quote between them, then it shows syntax error 
    Ex : print('Python's world')
                 It shows syntax error
         To avoid this syntax error, we should use slash
		 print('Python\'s world')   
*  ESCAPE SEQUENCE : 
 	\t is used for tab   Ex: print("Hello\tPython")
				 o/p - Hello	Python
        \n is used for new line       Ex: print("Hello\nPython")
 				 o/p -  Hello 
					Python
* Formatted Output
          name = "Akshay"
          marks =            
	  age = "21"
         1) print("The name of person is", name, "marks is", marks, "age is", age)
                 o/p - The name of person is Akshay, marks is 70, age is 21
          
    	 2) print("The name of person is %s marks is %f age is %d (name, marks, age))
	
		 
	 Variables - if, def, for cannot be used as variables
                      Ex : a10 is valid variable , 10a is not valid variable 
                            _10 = 6 is valid but not meaningful variable
  	

	In python, symbol for power is **


* Comparision operators
       
        a=10							a=10
        b=20  ---}  o/p - False                 		b=20    -----} o/p - True   
        a==b   							a!=b
                     
    		a!=b is valid, but a=!b is invalid 


*  Assignment Operators
         
         a=a+b
           a+=b is valid ,   a=+b is not right

*  Bitwise operators
         
         a=240
	 b=1    -----}  o/p -241
	 a|b    
*  Logical operators 
         
          Based on True and False 
           OR means addition
  	   And means multiplication


	T OR T   =   T 				T AND F = F
        T OR F   =   T				F AND T = F
	F OR T   =   T				F AND F = F
	F OR F   =   F              		T AND T = T

* Not operator 
        
      10<9   ----} False
      not 10<9  -----} True
	not True ------} false

* Membership operators
     
        It checks the presence of a particular letter

	str1 = "Program"                       "x in str1
		"a" in str1 			False 
		True       				                           
       
* Identity operators 
        
       a=10						a=10
	b=10	-----} True         			b=10   --------} False 
	a==b 						a is b 

* Operator precedence
       
       In an arithmetic operation, certain arithmetic operators have their precedence i.e which operator has got first preference while doing an arithmetic operation.
